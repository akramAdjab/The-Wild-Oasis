# The Wild Oasis // Hotel Management App

Introducing the Wild Oasis Management App, a comprehensive solution for streamlined hotel management. This sophisticated, multi-faceted application mandates user authentication to access its fortified database, reinforced by Role-Level Security (RLS). Within its intuitive dashboard, crucial information is elegantly presented, complemented by insightful charts. The bookings section simplifies access to reservation details and administration tasks, encompassing bill settlements and guest check-ins.

For a holistic view of cabin availability and the ability to make modifications or removals, the cabins page stands ready. Administrators wield authority on the users page, facilitating the addition of new users with their respective credentials. The settings page empowers swift updates to the hotel's core information. A dedicated account page empowers users to fine-tune their personal details, and an immersive dark mode feature elevates the overall user experience.

This app leverages an array of cutting-edge technologies to deliver its seamless functionality. Employing React Router for dynamic routing, React Query ensures efficient management of remote states, while React Recharts embellishes data presentation with elegant charts. The incorporation of React Hook Form simplifies form handling, and React Error Boundary guarantees robust error management. Context API orchestrates intuitive UI state control, while React Date-Fns contributes to precise date management. Users benefit from real-time notifications courtesy of React Hot Toast, and the app's aesthetics are crafted with finesse using Styled Components. The foundation of this technological marvel is grounded in Supabase, providing a robust and secure database architecture.
